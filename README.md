# ðŸŽ¨ Color Detection using OpenCV & Pandas

Have you ever wondered how software can identify the exact color you see in an image?  
This project demonstrates a **Color Detection Tool** built with **OpenCV, Pandas, and Python**.  

By simply clicking on any pixel in an image, the program detects the **closest color name**, along with its **RGB** and **HEX values**.  

This can be useful in:
- Image editing applications
- UI/UX design tools
- Accessibility software
- Real-time color identification for color-blind users
